If you use the dbuezas board package there is an intuitive menu option to select 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 or 1 MHz operation.

The board package takes care of frquency sensitive operations such as delay() or millis()...  You may need to watch
things if selecting certain baud rates - especially lower rates...

If you burn a new bootloader it will default to the frequency you selected so you will have to select the appropriate frequency from the menu to get understandabel results.
