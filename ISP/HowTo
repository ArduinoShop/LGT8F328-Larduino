a Step by Step guide to getting the LarduinoISP up and going..

A). download or clone the LarduinoISP from https://github.com/LGTMCU/LarduinoISP

B). modify SERIAL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE to 250 in HardwareSerial.h in wherever core you are going to use as a programmer...  For example I used an Arduino Nano and had to modify arduino-1.8.13/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/HardwareSerial.h under the directory where I had installed the Arduino IDE.  I changed the value of 64 to 256 ( even though David recommended using 250 - see the initial comments in the file ).

C). replace programmers.txt in ~/.arduino15/packages/LGT8fx Boards/hardware/avr/1.0.5 with the file included here.... or just add the following lines:

    avrisp.name=LarduinoISP
    avrisp.communication=serial
    avrisp.protocol=stk500v1
    avrisp.speed=115200
    avrisp.program.tool=avrdude
    avrisp.program.protocol=stk500v1
    avrisp.program.tool=avrdude
    avrisp.program.extra_params=-P{serial.port}

D). Upload the LarduinoISP sketch to the board you are going to use as a "programmer".

E). Connect your "programmer" to the target LGT8F328 board as shown in the diagram of the LarduinoISP package from Step A.
    NOTE - You Also need to disable the Reset on the "progammer" board by connecting a 10uF or so Capacitor from Vcc to Reset....
    .... or just jumper Reset directly to Vcc...  at least on an UNO or Nano...
    
F). In the Arduino IDE, select the appropriate LGTxx board, frequency, etc.  Make sure the PORT is set to that of the "programmer" board.
    Select the LarduinoISP programmer and use the Sketch->Upload using Programmer to up load your sketch to the target board, et la voila, your sketch should be
    uploaded and running.  Try resetting the board and observe how quickly it springs to life.  Also you have about 1/2KByte of extra flash to use..
